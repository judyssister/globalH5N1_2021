## Abstract

Will be available after manuscript published.

## File
### 01_MCC_TreeFile_and_Statistics_from_BEAST
- The MCC.tree appendices were generated from the BEAST v1.10.4 by Dr. LuLu.
- Time-scaled MCC tree of the eight gene segment of HPAIV H5N1 sequences found in the study and the related sequences from GISAID and NCBI influenza database. Discrete traits and continuous traits were reconstructed on time-scaled phylogeny. The 3 types of traits are: host type, HA/NA type, and geographic coordinates.
- Appendix file 1: Time-scaled MCC tree of the PB2 gene sequences 
- Appendix file 2: Time-scaled MCC tree of the PB1 gene sequences. 
- Appendix file 3: Time-scaled MCC tree of the PA gene sequences. 
- Appendix file 4: Time-scaled MCC tree of the HA gene sequences.
- Appendix file 5: Time-scaled MCC tree of the NP gene sequences. 
- Appendix file 6: Time-scaled MCC tree of the NA gene sequences. 
- Appendix file 7: Time-scaled MCC tree of the MP gene sequences. 
- Appendix file 8: Time-scaled MCC tree of the NS gene sequences.
- Appendix file 9: Summary of sequences used in each tree of Appendix file 1-8.

### 02_RAxML_tree
- The maximum likelihood trees were estimated by Dr. Jing Yang.
- Appendix_Figure2_global_H5_phylogeny.pdf. 

Phylogenetic tree of global H5 HA gene. The HA sequences generated in this study are labelled by green solid circle. The clade references are labelled by blue asterisks. The leftmost bars label different clades. The unit of scale bar is the number of mutations per site.

- Appendix_Figure3_phylogeny_of_NA_genes_of_global_H5N1.pdf 

Phylogenetic tree of NA gene of global H5N1. The NA sequences generated in this study are labelled by green solid circle. The other NA genes identified from mainland China are labelled by blue asterisks. The leftmost bars label different clades. The unit of scale bar is the number of mutations per site.
